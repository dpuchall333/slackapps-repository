Question: How does the Slack Events API handle Errors that may occur or 
unexpected events?

Answer:
When an event occurs, Slack sends a request URL from which a return HTTP 
response code of 200 OK is expected IF the event is successfully received.

If there is a redirect necessary, HTTP 301 or 302 may be returned.
In order for your app to stay active, there must be a response with 
success conditions for at least 5% of events "delivered" to the app.
The conditions under which an app will fail include: inability to
 negotiate or validate the server's SSL certificate, the app waits longer 
than 3 seconds to receive a valid response from the server, there are more 
than 2 HTTP redirects, any response other than HTTP 2xx response.
